# The `Meta` Block

Storybook's Doc Blocks are essential to writing accessible documentation. The `Meta` Doc Block captures the component metadata associated with your stories.

## Working with MDX

With Storybook MDX documentation, the `Meta` Doc Block is the way to extract the story's information and position it in the sidebar. Internally, Storybook looks for the Doc Block located at the top of your document and positions it accordingly based on the `title` prop. For example:

```mdx

{/* Button.mdx */}

import { Story, Canvas } from '@storybook/blocks';

import \* as ButtonStories from '../stories/Button.stories';

<Meta title="Button" />

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />
</Canvas>
```

If you already enabled automatic documentation for your stories via the `tags` configuration property, you can omit the `Meta` Doc Block altogether. In doing so, Storybook will infer the information and position the documentation page at the root level of the component's stories.

### Working with multiple components

Additionally, you can opt-out of using the `Meta` Doc Block if all your existing MDX files already have it defined. It's helpful in scenarios where you want to include stories from different files in a single documentation source. For example:

```mdx
{/* Page.mdx */}

import { Story, Canvas } from '@storybook/blocks';

import \* as ButtonStories from '../stories/Button.stories';
import \* as HeadingStories from '../stories/Heading.stories';

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} meta={ButtonStories} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={HeadingStories.H1} meta={HeadingStories} />
</Canvas>
```

Mixing and matching the `Meta` Doc block with the `Story` 's `meta` prop is also possible. In such cases, the `meta` prop defined at the top level will be used as the source for all other existing `Story` blocks which don't have the `meta` prop set.
