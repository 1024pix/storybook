# The `<Meta />` Block

The `<Meta />` block is a special block that is used to define the meta of the stories (the stories' default export) in the file.
It's not necessary when writing docs within Storybook (it doesn't do anything in that case),
but it _is_ required when writing Portable Docs.

As an example, let's pretend we wanted to include stories for a `<Button />` component in our docs outside of Storybook.
The MDX file would look like this:

```md
import { Meta, Story, Canvas } from '@storybook/blocks';
import \* as ButtonStories from '../stories/Button.stories';

<Meta of={ButtonStories} />

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />
</Canvas>
```

In the above example, the `<Meta />` block communicates to all the `<Story />` blocks which meta they're related to.

The `<Meta />` block can be omitted if `<Story />` blocks instead have the `meta` prop explicitly set.
This is useful in scenarios where you want to include stories from different story files in a single MDX file, like this:

```md
import { Meta, Story, Canvas } from '@storybook/blocks';
import \* as ButtonStories from '../stories/Button.stories';
import \* as HeadingStories from '../stories/Heading.stories';

<Meta of={ButtonStories} />

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} meta={ButtonStories} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={HeadingStories.H1} meta={HeadingStories} />
</Canvas>
```

It's also possible to mix and match the `<Meta />` block with the `meta` prop on `<Story />` blocks. In that case,
the meta referenced by the `<Meta />` block will be used as the default meta for all `<Story />` blocks that don't have the `meta` prop set.
