# Contributing to Storybook

## How to get started

1. Ensure you're in an environment with the [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) command available.
   If you are on Windows, you will want to run in a [windows subsystem for linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)
2. Install [`bun`](https://bun.sh/)
   ```bash
   curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```
   After installing you will likely need to reload the shell.
3. run:
    ```bash
    ./dev.ts
    ```
